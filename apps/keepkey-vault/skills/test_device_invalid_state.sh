echo ""
echo "1. Automatic Detection:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Detects 'Timeout while fetching device features' errors"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Shows a simple, single-page dialog instead of complex wizard"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Clear instructions: Unplug and reconnect device normally"
echo ""
echo "2. Improved Dialog Management:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Prevents multiple dialogs from opening simultaneously"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ PIN dialog always has highest priority (z-index: 99999)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Lower priority dialogs are automatically closed"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Queuing system prevents dialog conflicts"
echo ""
echo "3. Better Error Handling:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Specific handling for device timeout errors"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Emits 'device:invalid-state' event from backend"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Frontend shows DeviceInvalidStateDialog component"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ All other dialogs are closed to prevent confusion"
echo ""
echo -e "${BLUE}üß™ How to Test:${NC}"
echo ""
echo "1. Connect a KeepKey device"
echo "2. Cause a timeout error by:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Disconnecting during communication"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Using device with another app"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Device in unexpected state"
echo ""
echo "3. You'll see the new dialog appear with:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Orange warning border"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Clear error message"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Simple reconnection instructions"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ No complex wizard steps"
echo ""
echo -e "${YELLOW}‚ö†Ô∏è  Important Changes:${NC}"
echo ""
echo "‚Ä¢ Old behavior: Complex troubleshooting wizard with multiple steps"
echo "‚Ä¢ New behavior: Simple one-page dialog with reconnection instructions"
echo "‚Ä¢ PIN dialogs now always stay on top when device is ready"
echo "‚Ä¢ Prevents dialog stacking and z-axis issues"
echo ""
echo -e "${GREEN}üì± Dialog Priority System:${NC}"
echo ""
echo "1. PIN dialogs: Always highest priority (critical)"
echo "2. Device invalid state: High priority"
echo "3. Update dialogs: Normal/high priority"
echo "4. Other dialogs: Lower priority"

echo "Lower priority dialogs are automatically closed when"
