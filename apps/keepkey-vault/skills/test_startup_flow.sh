echo "1. âœ… Unified Application State"
echo "   - Single appState object managing startup and device state"
echo "   - Comprehensive device state tracking (connected, features, status, error)"
echo "   - Clear startup progression tracking"
echo ""

echo "2. âœ… Improved Event System"
echo "   - device:connected - Basic device connection event"
echo "   - device:ready - Device with features loaded and ready"
echo "   - device:disconnected - Device removal event"
echo "   - device:features-updated - Features update event"
echo "   - device:access-error - Device access/permission errors"
echo "   - application:startup - Backend monitoring initialization"
echo "   - application:restart - Backend restart events"
echo ""

echo "3. âœ… Backend Improvements"
echo "   - Event controller proactively fetches device features"
echo "   - Comprehensive error handling for device access issues"
echo "   - Timeout protection for feature fetching"
echo "   - Better device state change notifications"
echo ""

echo "4. âœ… Frontend Improvements"
echo "   - Checks for existing devices on startup (no more race conditions)"
echo "   - Unified state management with helper functions"
echo "   - Better error handling and user feedback"  
echo "   - Clearer startup progression messages"

echo "1. Start Vault V2:"
echo "   cd /Users/highlander/keepkey-bitcoin-only/projects/vault-v2"
echo "   npm run tauri dev"
echo ""
echo "2. Test scenarios:"
echo "   a) Start with device already connected"
echo "   b) Start without device, then connect"
echo "   c) Disconnect and reconnect device"
echo "   d) Test with device in use by another app"
echo "   e) Click logo to restart backend"
