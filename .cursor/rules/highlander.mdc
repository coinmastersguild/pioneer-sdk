# Tags

the top of every file needs a tag

const TAG = " | filename | "

every function if should have a try catch


let demoFunction = async function(){
    tag = TAG + " | demoFunction | "
    try{
        ** code here **
        return foo
    }catch(e){
        console.error(e)
        throw e
    }
}

Notice the tag is the ONLY part out of the try
notice that tag has both global and function tag

every async function must thow  @rules failfast
